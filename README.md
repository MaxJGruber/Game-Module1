IRON GUITAR is an imitation of world-famous video game “Guitar Hero”.

#Goal
Score points by tapping the notes when they are on the fret-board.

#Streaks
The more consecutive notes you hit, the higher your note streak .

#Multipliers
The higher your streak, the higher your points multiply.

IRON GUITAR was created using JavaScript, in 5 days, by ME alone, as a first project for my Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack Paris.
